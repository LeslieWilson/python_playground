# this will be a flashcard app that quizzes you on stored flashcards or allows you to create new flashcards.

# command prompt interface, asks you if you want to make a new flashcard or go through saved flashcards

# if you make a new flash card - it asks for the question - saves it to a text file - then it asks for the answer and saves it to the same text file, with a comma or a new line after the question

# then if you ask to go through the flashcards it types when out and tells you to type a for the answer or something, it reads the first line of the text file for the question, then reads the next line for the answer and keeps looping through the file
